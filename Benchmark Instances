Benchmark Set 1: Basic CNF Formulas

F1 (SAT): (A OR B) AND (NOT A OR C)
F2 (UNSAT): (A) AND (NOT A)
F3 (UNSAT): (A OR B) AND (A OR NOT B) AND (NOT A OR B) AND (NOT A OR NOT B)
F4 (SAT): (A OR NOT B OR C) AND (B OR NOT C OR D) AND (NOT A OR NOT D)

Benchmark Set 2: Parity Problems (XOR-SAT)

XOR-3 (SAT): (X1 OR X2 OR X3) AND (NOT X1 OR NOT X2 OR X3) AND (NOT X1 OR X2 OR NOT X3) AND (X1 OR NOT X2 OR NOT X3)

XOR-4 (SAT): (X1 OR X2 OR X3 OR X4) AND (X1 OR X2 OR NOT X3 OR NOT X4) AND (X1 OR NOT X2 OR X3 OR NOT X4) AND (X1 OR NOT X2 OR NOT X3 OR X4) AND (NOT X1 OR X2 OR X3 OR NOT X4) AND (NOT X1 OR X2 OR NOT X3 OR X4) AND (NOT X1 OR NOT X2 OR X3 OR X4) AND (NOT X1 OR NOT X2 OR NOT X3 OR NOT X4)

XYZ

LinkedXOR (SAT): ((X1 OR X2 OR X3) AND (NOT X1 OR NOT X2 OR X3) AND (NOT X1 OR X2 OR NOT X3) AND (X1 OR NOT X2 OR NOT X3)) AND ((X3 OR X4 OR X5) AND (NOT X3 OR NOT X4 OR X5) AND (NOT X3 OR X4 OR NOT X5) AND (X3 OR NOT X4 OR NOT X5))
(Note: Represents (X1 XOR X2 XOR X3) AND (X3 XOR X4 XOR X5)
